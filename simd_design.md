# SIMD-like Bit Manipulation Design Document

This document details the design and implementation of SIMD-like bit manipulation operations for the GPT-2 BASIC project, allowing us to process multiple values in parallel within standard 32-bit integers.

## Overview

The 486 processor lacks dedicated SIMD instructions that are common in modern CPUs. However, we can emulate SIMD-like behavior by packing multiple smaller values into a single 32-bit integer and operating on them simultaneously through bit manipulation. This "poor man's SIMD" approach can significantly accelerate certain operations, especially in matrix calculations which form the core of transformer models.

## Design Goals

1. **Performance Improvement**: Achieve 1.5-2x speedup for matrix operations
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce memory footprint by storing multiple values in a single integer
3. **Precision Options**: Support multiple precision levels (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit)
4. **Flexibility**: Allow dynamic selection of precision based on computational requirements
5. **Compatibility**: Ensure operation on all 486-era hardware variants

## Precision Adaptation

The system will include functions to dynamically select the appropriate precision level based on the computational needs and hardware capabilities:

```basic
' Enumeration for precision levels
ENUM PrecisionLevel
    PRECISION_4BIT = 1  ' Lowest precision, 8 values per 32-bit integer
    PRECISION_8BIT = 2  ' Medium precision, 4 values per 32-bit integer
    PRECISION_16BIT = 3 ' Higher precision, 2 values per 32-bit integer
    PRECISION_32BIT = 4 ' Full precision, 1 value per 32-bit integer
END ENUM

' Determine the optimal precision level for a matrix operation
FUNCTION DetermineOptimalPrecision(rows AS INTEGER, cols AS INTEGER, operation_type AS INTEGER) AS PrecisionLevel
    DIM matrix_size AS LONG = rows * cols
    
    ' Small matrices use higher precision
    IF matrix_size < 256 THEN
        RETURN PRECISION_32BIT
    END IF
    
    ' Very large matrices use lowest precision
    IF matrix_size > 4096 THEN
        RETURN PRECISION_4BIT
    END IF
    
    ' For attention operations, use lower precision
    IF operation_type = OPERATION_ATTENTION AND matrix_size > 1024 THEN
        RETURN PRECISION_4BIT
    END IF
    
    ' Default to 8-bit precision
    RETURN PRECISION_8BIT
END FUNCTION

' Matrix multiplication with adaptive precision
SUB MatrixMultiplyAdaptive(A AS Matrix, B AS Matrix, C AS Matrix, operation_type AS INTEGER)
    DIM precision AS PrecisionLevel
    
    ' Determine optimal precision
    precision = DetermineOptimalPrecision(A.rows, B.cols, operation_type)
    
    ' Call appropriate implementation based on precision

        CASE PRECISION_32BIT:
            ' Use standard matrix multiplication
            MatrixMultiply(A, B, C)
    END SELECT
END SUB
```

## CPU Detection and Optimization

The system will detect the CPU type to enable optimizations specific to different 486 variants:

```basic
' CPU type enumeration
ENUM CPUType
    CPU_486SX = 1 ' No FPU
    CPU_486DX = 2 ' With FPU
    CPU_486DX2 = 3 ' With FPU, higher clock

    CPU_PENTIUM = 5 ' Pentium or higher
END ENUM

DIM SHARED g_cpu_type AS CPUType ' Global CPU type
DIM SHARED g_has_fpu AS INTEGER ' Whether FPU is available

' Detect CPU type and capabilities
FUNCTION DetectCPU() AS CPUType
    DIM cpu_type AS CPUType
    DIM has_fpu AS INTEGER
    
    ' This would be replaced with actual 486-era CPU detection
    ' For modern testing, we'll use a placeholder

        END IF
    #ENDIF
    
    ' Store in global variables
    g_cpu_type = cpu_type

END FUNCTION

' Test for FPU presence (simple test)

    #IFDEF __FB_64BIT__
        fpu_available = 1
    #ELSE
        ' Simple test that would be replaced with actual detection
        ' such as checking the FPU control word or attempting a simple calculation
        ON ERROR GOTO no_fpu
        DIM x AS SINGLE = 1.0
        DIM y AS SINGLE = x / 3.0

    #ENDIF
    
    RETURN fpu_available
END FUNCTION
```

## Testing and Validation

To ensure the correctness of the SIMD-like implementation, we'll create comprehensive test cases:

```basic
' Test SIMD-like operations for 8-bit precision

    DIM a_packed AS LONG, b_packed AS LONG, result AS LONG
    DIM a1 AS BYTE, a2 AS BYTE, a3 AS BYTE, a4 AS BYTE
    DIM b1 AS BYTE, b2 AS BYTE, b3 AS BYTE, b4 AS BYTE
    DIM r1 AS BYTE, r2 AS BYTE, r3 AS BYTE, r4 AS BYTE
    
    ' Test Pack_8bit
    a_packed = Pack_8bit(10, 20, 30, 40)
    Unpack_8bit(a_packed, a1, a2, a3, a4)
    PRINT "Pack/Unpack 8-bit Test:"
    PRINT "Expected: 10, 20, 30, 40"
    PRINT "Actual: "; a1; ", "; a2; ", "; a3; ", "; a4

    result = SIMD_Add_8bit(a_packed, b_packed)
    Unpack_8bit(result, r1, r2, r3, r4)
    PRINT "SIMD_Add_8bit Test:"
    PRINT "Expected: 15, 30, 45, 60"
    PRINT "Actual: "; r1; ", "; r2; ", "; r3; ", "; r4
    
    ' Test overflow handling
    a_packed = Pack_8bit(250, 250, 250, 250)
    b_packed = Pack_8bit(10, 10, 10, 10)
    result = SIMD_Add_8bit(a_packed, b_packed)
    Unpack_8bit(result, r1, r2, r3, r4)
    PRINT "SIMD_Add_8bit Overflow Test:"
    PRINT "Expected: 4, 4, 4, 4 (with overflow wrapping)"
    PRINT "Actual: "; r1; ", "; r2; ", "; r3; ", "; r4

    PRINT "Actual: "; r1; ", "; r2; ", "; r3; ", "; r4
END SUB
```

## Performance Benchmarking

## Integration Points

The SIMD-like bit manipulation functionality will integrate with the following system components:

1. **Matrix Operations (matrix_ops.bas)**
   - Enhanced matrix multiplication, addition, and elementwise operations
   - Automatic precision selection based on operation and matrix size

2. **Transformer Components (transformer_components.bas)**
   - Optimized attention mechanism calculations
   - Accelerated feed-forward network processing

3. **Model Operations (model.bas)**
   - Efficient embedding and token processing
   - Optimized layer calculations

4. **Benchmarking System (benchmark.bas)**
   - Performance comparisons between standard and SIMD-like operations
   - Memory usage analysis

## Implementation Sequence

The implementation will proceed in the following order:

1. Basic packing and unpacking functions for all precisions
2. SIMD-like arithmetic operations for 8-bit values
3. Optimized matrix multiplication for 8-bit values
4. CPU detection and precision selection
5. Remaining arithmetic operations for all precisions
6. Integration with matrix operations system
7. Performance testing and optimization
8. Documentation of all functions

## Success Criteria

The SIMD-like bit manipulation component will be considered successful when:

1. Matrix operations show at least 1.5x speedup compared to standard implementation
2. All operations produce numerically correct results within acceptable error tolerance
3. Memory usage is reduced through packed representation
4. Automatic precision selection correctly balances performance and accuracy
5. Implementation works correctly on all supported CPU types
