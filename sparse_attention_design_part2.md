## Implementation Sequence

The block-sparse attention component will be implemented in the following sequence:

1. **Core Data Structures**
   - Implement `SparseBlock` and `SparseBlockMatrix` types
   - Develop basic block management functions (add, find, free)

   - Implement efficient creation of causal masks in sparse format
   - Optimize block selection for triangular patterns

4. **Attention Integration**
   - Implement sparse attention score computation
   - Create efficient softmax for sparse blocks
   - Develop full sparse attention implementation

5. **Adaptive Selection**
   - Implement heuristics for dense vs. sparse selection
   - Create wrapper functions that select optimal implementation

6. **Optimization**
   - Integrate with SIMD-like operations
   - Implement hash-based block lookup
   - Optimize memory management

7. **Testing and Benchmarking**
   - Validate correctness against dense implementation
   - Benchmark performance across different sequence lengths
   - Measure memory savings

## Integration Points

The block-sparse attention functionality will integrate with the following system components:

1. **Transformer Components (transformer_components.bas)**
   - Self-attention mechanisms
   - Multi-head attention implementation
   - Encoder and decoder layers

   - Integrate with optimized SIMD-like functions

3. **Memory Management System**
   - Track and limit memory usage
   - Reuse allocated blocks where possible

## Success Criteria

The block-sparse attention implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by at least 40% for sequence lengths ≥ 64
2. **Performance**: Matches or exceeds dense attention performance for appropriate sequence lengths
3. **Correctness**: Produces results equivalent to dense attention within acceptable tolerances
4. **Flexibility**: Automatically selects optimal implementation based on context
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with other transformer components

## Conclusion

Block-sparse attention is a critical optimization for enabling transformer models to operate within 486-era memory constraints. By only storing and computing the non-zero blocks of attention matrices, we can significantly reduce memory requirements while maintaining or even improving performance, especially for autoregressive generation with causal masking.

The implementation provides a flexible approach that adapts to different sequence lengths and attention patterns, automatically selecting the most efficient representation based on the specific context. It integrates seamlessly with other optimizations like SIMD-like operations and fixed-point arithmetic to create a complete system capable of running transformer models on vintage hardware.
