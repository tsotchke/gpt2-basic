## Technical Implementation Highlights

### SIMD-like Bit Manipulation

The core approach for SIMD-like operations involves packing multiple values into a single 32-bit integer and operating on them simultaneously. This has been successfully implemented through bit-level manipulation:

```basic
' Pack 4 8-bit values into a single 32-bit integer
FUNCTION Pack_8bit(v1 AS BYTE, v2 AS BYTE, v3 AS BYTE, v4 AS BYTE) AS LONG
    FUNCTION = ((CLNG(v1) AND &HFF)) OR _
               ((CLNG(v2) AND &HFF) << 8) OR _
               ((CLNG(v3) AND &HFF) << 16) OR _
               ((CLNG(v4) AND &HFF) << 24)
END FUNCTION

' Unpack values from a 32-bit integer
SUB Unpack_8bit(packed AS LONG, BYREF v1 AS BYTE, BYREF v2 AS BYTE, BYREF v3 AS BYTE, BYREF v4 AS BYTE)
    v1 = packed AND &HFF
    v2 = (packed >> 8) AND &HFF
    v3 = (packed >> 16) AND &HFF
    v4 = (packed >> 24) AND &HFF
END SUB

' SIMD-like addition for 4 packed 8-bit values
FUNCTION SIMD_Add_8bit(a AS LONG, b AS LONG) AS LONG
    DIM result AS LONG = a + b
    DIM overflow_mask AS LONG = &H01010100 ' Bits that would carry between elements
    
    ' Handle potential overflow between elements
    result = (result AND (NOT overflow_mask)) OR _
             ((a AND b AND overflow_mask))
    
    FUNCTION = result
END FUNCTION
```

The matrix operations have been successfully modified to use these packed operations for improved performance:

```basic
' Matrix multiplication using SIMD-like operations
SUB MatrixMultiplySIMD(A AS Matrix, B AS Matrix, C AS Matrix)
    DIM i AS INTEGER, j AS INTEGER, k AS INTEGER
    DIM temp_sum AS LONG
    DIM a_val AS LONG, b_val AS LONG, product AS LONG
    
    FOR i = 0 TO A.rows - 1
        FOR j = 0 TO B.cols - 1
            temp_sum = 0
            
            ' Process 4 elements at a time using packed values
            FOR k = 0 TO A.cols - 4 STEP 4
                a_val = Pack_8bit(A.data(i, k), A.data(i, k+1), A.data(i, k+2), A.data(i, k+3))
                b_val = Pack_8bit(B.data(k, j), B.data(k+1, j), B.data(k+2, j), B.data(k+3, j))
                
                ' Compute packed product and add to sum
                product = SIMD_Multiply_8bit(a_val, b_val)
                temp_sum = SIMD_Add_8bit(temp_sum, product)
            NEXT k
            
            ' Handle remaining elements
            FOR k = k TO A.cols - 1
                temp_sum = temp_sum + A.data(i, k) * B.data(k, j)
            NEXT k
            
            C.data(i, j) = temp_sum
        NEXT j
    NEXT i
END SUB
```

### Block-Sparse Attention

Block-sparse attention reduces memory usage by only storing and computing non-zero blocks of the attention matrix:

```basic
TYPE SparseBlock
    row_start AS INTEGER    ' Starting row of this block
    col_start AS INTEGER    ' Starting column of this block
    block_size AS INTEGER   ' Size of this block (typically power of 2)
    data() AS INTEGER       ' Block data stored as LogQuantized values
    next AS SparseBlock PTR ' Pointer to next block in linked list
END TYPE

TYPE SparseBlockMatrix
    blocks AS SparseBlock PTR ' Head of linked list of blocks
    rows AS INTEGER          ' Total rows in the full matrix
    cols AS INTEGER          ' Total columns in the full matrix
    block_size AS INTEGER    ' Standard block size
    num_blocks AS INTEGER    ' Number of blocks in the matrix
END TYPE

' Initialize a sparse block matrix
SUB InitSparseBlockMatrix(matrix AS SparseBlockMatrix, rows AS INTEGER, cols AS INTEGER, block_size AS INTEGER)
    matrix.rows = rows
    matrix.cols = cols
    matrix.block_size = block_size
    matrix.blocks = NULL
    matrix.num_blocks = 0
END SUB

' Create a block-sparse matrix from a causal attention mask
SUB CreateCausalSparseMask(matrix AS SparseBlockMatrix, seq_len AS INTEGER)
    DIM block_size AS INTEGER = matrix.block_size
    DIM num_blocks AS INTEGER = (seq_len + block_size - 1) \ block_size
    
    ' Create blocks for the upper triangular portion (including diagonal)
    FOR i = 0 TO num_blocks - 1
        FOR j = 0 TO i
            ' Add this block to the sparse matrix
            AddSparseBlock(matrix, i * block_size, j * block_size)
        NEXT j
    NEXT i
END SUB
```

### Assembly-Optimized Fixed-Point Operations

Critical fixed-point operations have been successfully implemented in assembly for maximum performance:

```assembly
; Fixed-point multiplication (Q16.16 format)
; Input: ax:bx = first operand (32-bit fixed-point)
;        cx:dx = second operand (32-bit fixed-point)
; Output: ax:bx = result (32-bit fixed-point)
PUBLIC _FixedMulAsm
_FixedMulAsm PROC
    push    bp          ; Save base pointer
    mov     bp, sp      ; Set up stack frame
    
    push    si          ; Save registers
    push    di
    
    ; Get parameters from stack
    mov     ax, [bp+8]  ; High word of first operand
    mov     bx, [bp+6]  ; Low word of first operand
    mov     cx, [bp+12] ; High word of second operand
    mov     dx, [bp+10] ; Low word of second operand
    
    ; Compute partial products
    ; We need to compute (ax:bx * cx:dx) >> 16
    
    ; Compute bx * dx (low * low)
    mov     si, bx      ; Save bx
    mov     di, dx      ; Save dx
    mov     ax, bx
    mul     dx          ; dx:ax = bx * dx
    push    dx          ; Save high part
    push    ax          ; Save low part
    
    ; Compute ax * di (high * low)
    mov     bx, ax      ; Restore ax to bx
    mul     di          ; dx:ax = ax * di (high * low)
    add     ax, [bp-4]  ; Add to previous high part
    adc     dx, 0       ; Add carry to dx
    push    dx          ; Save overflow
    push    ax          ; Save result
    
    ; Compute si * cx (low * high)
    mov     ax, si
    mul     cx          ; dx:ax = si * cx (low * high)
    add     ax, [bp-6]  ; Add to previous result
    adc     dx, [bp-8]  ; Add carry and overflow
    
    ; Shift result right by 16 (divide by 2^16)
    mov     bx, ax      ; Low word of result
    mov     ax, dx      ; High word of result
    shr     ax, 16      ; Shift right by 16
    shl     bx, 16      ; Shift left by 16
    or      ax, bx      ; Combine for final result
    
    ; Clean up and return
    pop     di
    pop     si
    pop     bp
    ret
_FixedMulAsm ENDP
```

The assembly code has been wrapped in a BASIC function with fallback for systems without assembly support:

```basic
FUNCTION FixedMultiply(a AS LONG, b AS LONG) AS LONG
    DIM result AS LONG
    
    #IFDEF USE_ASSEMBLY
        IF HasAssemblySupport() THEN
            result = FixedMulAsm(a, b)
        ELSE
            ' Fallback implementation
            result = FixedMultiplyFallback(a, b)
        END IF
    #ELSE
        result = FixedMultiplyFallback(a, b)
    #ENDIF
    
    RETURN result
END FUNCTION
```

### Memory Tracking System

A comprehensive memory tracking system ensures operations stay within 486-era constraints:

```basic
TYPE MemoryTracker
    total_allocated AS LONG     ' Total memory currently allocated
    peak_allocated AS LONG      ' Peak memory allocation
    num_allocations AS INTEGER  ' Number of active allocations
    memory_limit AS LONG        ' Maximum allowed allocation
END TYPE

DIM SHARED g_memory_tracker AS MemoryTracker

' Initialize the memory tracker
SUB InitMemoryTracker(memory_limit AS LONG)
    g_memory_tracker.total_allocated = 0
    g_memory_tracker.peak_allocated = 0
    g_memory_tracker.num_allocations = 0
    g_memory_tracker.memory_limit = memory_limit
END SUB

' Track a memory allocation
FUNCTION TrackedAllocate(size AS LONG) AS ANY PTR
    ' Check if allocation would exceed memory limit
    IF g_memory_tracker.total_allocated + size > g_memory_tracker.memory_limit THEN
        PRINT "ERROR: Memory allocation would exceed limit"
        RETURN NULL
    END IF
    
    ' Perform the allocation
    DIM ptr AS ANY PTR = ALLOCATE(size)
    
    ' Update tracking information
    g_memory_tracker.total_allocated = g_memory_tracker.total_allocated + size
    g_memory_tracker.num_allocations = g_memory_tracker.num_allocations + 1
    
    ' Update peak if needed
    IF g_memory_tracker.total_allocated > g_memory_tracker.peak_allocated THEN
        g_memory_tracker.peak_allocated = g_memory_tracker.total_allocated
    END IF
    
    RETURN ptr
END FUNCTION

' Track a memory deallocation
SUB TrackedDeallocate(ptr AS ANY PTR, size AS LONG)
    DEALLOCATE(ptr)
    
    ' Update tracking information
    g_memory_tracker.total_allocated = g_memory_tracker.total_allocated - size
    g_memory_tracker.num_allocations = g_memory_tracker.num_allocations - 1
END SUB
```
