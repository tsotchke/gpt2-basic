# GPT-2 BASIC Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the GPT-2 BASIC project, tying together all our design specifications and establishing a clear path for development. It serves as the central reference for the implementation process, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## Project Overview

GPT-2 BASIC aims to implement a scaled-down GPT-2 transformer model in FreeBASIC that is theoretically compatible with 486-era hardware constraints. The project demonstrates that modern AI concepts can be implemented on vintage hardware through careful optimization and innovative approaches.

### Key Constraints
- 32MB RAM limit
- 486 processor (DX4/100MHz ideal target)
- No modern SIMD instructions
- Limited FPU capabilities (especially on 486SX)

### Design Approach
Our approach balances authenticity to 486-era constraints with the need for a functional transformer model through:
1. Careful memory management
2. Optimized computation
3. Efficient data representation
4. Graceful adaptation to hardware limitations
