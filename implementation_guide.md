# GPT-2 BASIC Implementation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the completed GPT-2 BASIC project, detailing how all components work together in the final implementation. It serves as the central guide to understanding the system architecture and implementation details.

## Project Overview

GPT-2 BASIC has successfully implemented a scaled-down GPT-2 transformer model in FreeBASIC that is compatible with 486-era hardware constraints. The project demonstrates that modern AI concepts can be implemented on vintage hardware through careful optimization and innovative approaches.

### Key Constraints Addressed
- 32MB RAM limit
- 486 processor (DX4/100MHz ideal target)
- No modern SIMD instructions
- Limited FPU capabilities (especially on 486SX)

### Implementation Approach
Our approach balanced authenticity to 486-era constraints with the need for a functional transformer model through:
1. Careful memory management
2. Optimized computation
3. Efficient data representation
4. Graceful adaptation to hardware limitations
