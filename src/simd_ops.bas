' * This module implements SIMD-like operations using    *
' * bit manipulation to process multiple values in       *
' * parallel within standard 32-bit integers.            *
' *                                                      *
' * Since 486-era processors lack dedicated SIMD         *
' * instructions, we emulate them by packing multiple    *
' * smaller values into single integers and operating    *
' * on them simultaneously.                              *
