' Note on Optimization:
' The current implementation uses fixed-point arithmetic, which is better than
' floating-point for 486. However, significant further optimization is needed.
'
' SIMD-like Operations:
' For matrix multiplication, we can process multiple elements in parallel using bit
' manipulation on packed integers (as discussed in the user's feedback). This requires
' careful packing and unpacking of 4-bit values and implementing the multiplication/addition
' logic using bitwise operations. This would replace the inner loop (k loop) or process
' blocks of the matrices. This is a complex optimization for BASIC.
'
' Block Processing:
' For large matrices, we need to process them in smaller blocks that fit into available
' memory. This involves loading blocks from disk (if streaming) or processing sub-matrices
' that fit in RAM. The MatrixMultiply function would need to be modified to iterate
' over these blocks. This is crucial for handling the 1M parameters within 32MB RAM.
'
' Assembly Language:
' For the most critical inner loops (especially in matrix multiplication), writing
' assembly language routines and calling them from BASIC (if the compiler supports it,
' like PowerBASIC) could provide significant speedups by directly utilizing 486
' instructions and registers.
