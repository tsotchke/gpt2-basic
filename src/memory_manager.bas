' * Memory Management for GPT-2 BASIC                   *
' *******************************************************
' * This module implements memory tracking, pooling,    *
' * and parameter streaming to enable transformer       *
' * models to operate within the limited memory         *
' * constraints of 486-era hardware.                    *
' *                                                      *
' * It provides mechanisms to stream model parameters   *
' * from disk on demand, track and limit memory usage,  *
' * and efficiently pool matrix allocations to avoid    *
' * fragmentation.                                      *
