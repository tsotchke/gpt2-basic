' BASIC implementation of data structures for the GPT-2-like model
' This file defines structures for representing tensors and matrices.

' Define a simple matrix structure using a multi-dimensional array.
' This will be adapted later for 4-bit quantized and fixed-point data.
TYPE Matrix
    ' Dimensions of the matrix
    rows AS INTEGER
    cols AS INTEGER
    ' Data storage (using INTEGER for now, will change for quantization)
    ' In FreeBASIC, arrays can be dynamic, but for 486 compatibility,
    ' we might need to manage memory more explicitly or use fixed-size arrays/memory blocks.
    ' For initial implementation, we'll use dynamic arrays if supported by FreeBASIC.
    ' DIM data(rows, cols) AS INTEGER ' Example dynamic array declaration
    
    ' Placeholder for data pointer or handle for explicit memory management
    ' This will be crucial for 486 compatibility and memory streaming.
    ' data_ptr AS ANY PTR
    
    ' For now, a simple dynamic array representation in FreeBASIC
    ' This will need refinement for strict 486 memory constraints.
    data() AS INTEGER ' Dynamic array to hold matrix elements
END TYPE

' Function to initialize a Matrix
' This is a placeholder and will need refinement based on memory management strategy.
SUB InitMatrix (m AS Matrix, num_rows AS INTEGER, num_cols AS INTEGER)
    m.rows = num_rows
    m.cols = num_cols
    ' Redimension the dynamic array
    REDIM m.data(num_rows - 1, num_cols - 1) ' BASIC arrays are often 0-indexed
END SUB

' Function to free memory for a Matrix (placeholder)
' Essential for memory management on constrained systems.
SUB FreeMatrix (m AS Matrix)
    ' In FreeBASIC, ERASE might work for dynamic arrays.
    ' For explicit memory, we'd need a custom deallocation routine.
    ERASE m.data
    m.rows = 0
    m.cols = 0
END SUB

' Note: The actual implementation for 486 compatibility will likely require
' explicit memory allocation and deallocation using PEEK/POKE or similar
' memory manipulation functions, or careful use of fixed-size arrays
' within defined memory segments. The dynamic array approach here is
' primarily for ease of development in a modern BASIC dialect like FreeBASIC.
